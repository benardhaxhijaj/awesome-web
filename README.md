Welcome to my personal website!

This website is created as a way for me to practice and improve my basic level skills in HTML and CSS. As I progress through my learning journey, I will be updating this website to showcase my new skills and techniques.

On this website, you will find various pages that I have created using HTML and CSS. These pages are designed to be simple, yet functional, and demonstrate some of the basic concepts that I have learned.

I am excited to continue learning and growing as a web developer, and I hope that you enjoy exploring my website as much as I have enjoyed creating it.

Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to sharing my progress with you!
